# e-certificate

My sister had a problem. She is working at a college, and every semester she has to prepare certificates for all students of all courses MANUALLY. I noticed that the structure of the certificates was simple and repetitive. So, I created a program that she could <strong>import student data</strong> using a spreadsheet, could <strong>manipulate the basic text</strong> placement parameters, and apply that to all certificates in one click. Now, the program is online and available for her to access and generate her certificates optimally.
